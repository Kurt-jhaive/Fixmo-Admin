# Dispute Resolution System - Admin Panel Update

## Overview
Updated the admin panel to use the correct API endpoints for approving and rejecting backjob disputes, based on the official API documentation.

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. New API Methods (src/lib/api.ts)

Added two new dedicated methods to `appointmentsApi`:

#### `approveDispute(backjobId, adminNotes)`
```typescript
async approveDispute(backjobId: number, adminNotes: string): Promise<any> {
  const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest(
    `${API_BASE_URL}/api/appointments/backjobs/${backjobId}/approve-dispute`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ admin_notes: adminNotes }),
    }
  );
  // ... error handling
  return response.json();
}
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/appointments/backjobs/:backjobId/approve-dispute`

**What it does:**
- Sides with the provider
- Cancels customer's backjob request
- Changes backjob status to `cancelled-by-admin`
- Changes appointment status to `in-warranty`
- Resumes warranty from paused state
- Sends emails to both customer and provider

---

#### `rejectDispute(backjobId, adminNotes)`
```typescript
async rejectDispute(backjobId: number, adminNotes: string): Promise<any> {
  const response = await makeAuthenticatedRequest(
    `${API_BASE_URL}/api/appointments/backjobs/${backjobId}/reject-dispute`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ admin_notes: adminNotes }),
    }
  );
  // ... error handling
  return response.json();
}
```

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/appointments/backjobs/:backjobId/reject-dispute`

**What it does:**
- Sides with the customer
- Keeps backjob request active
- Changes backjob status to `approved`
- Appointment remains in `backjob` status
- Warranty remains paused
- Sends emails to both customer and provider
- Provider must reschedule

---

### 2. Updated Component Handlers (src/app/dashboard/appointments/page.tsx)

#### Updated `handleApproveDispute()`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Used generic updateBackjob with action: 'cancel-by-admin'
const response = await appointmentsApi.updateBackjob(backjobId, {
  action: 'cancel-by-admin',
  admin_notes: 'Admin approved provider dispute. Appointment completed.'
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Uses dedicated approveDispute endpoint
const response = await appointmentsApi.approveDispute(backjobId, adminNotes.trim());
```

**Improvements:**
- Prompts admin for decision notes (required)
- Clearer confirmation message explaining the action
- Uses correct endpoint that sends proper email notifications
- Better success/error messages

---

#### Updated `handleRejectDispute()`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Used generic updateBackjob with action: 'cancel-by-user'
const response = await appointmentsApi.updateBackjob(backjobId, {
  action: 'cancel-by-user',
  admin_notes: 'Admin rejected provider dispute. Backjob reinstated.'
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Uses dedicated rejectDispute endpoint
const response = await appointmentsApi.rejectDispute(backjobId, adminNotes.trim());
```

**Improvements:**
- Prompts admin for decision notes (required)
- Clearer confirmation message explaining the action
- Uses correct endpoint that sends proper email notifications
- Better success/error messages

---

### 3. Enhanced UI (Button Labels & Tooltips)

**Updated button labels to be more descriptive:**

```tsx
{/* Cancel Button */}
<button onClick={() => handleCancelBackjob(backjob.backjob_id)}
  title="Permanently cancel this backjob">
  üö´ Cancel Backjob
</button>

{/* Reject Dispute Button */}
<button onClick={() => handleRejectDispute(backjob.backjob_id)}
  title="Reject provider's dispute - backjob remains active, provider must reschedule">
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Reject Dispute (Side with Customer)
</button>

{/* Approve Dispute Button */}
<button onClick={() => handleApproveDispute(backjob.backjob_id)}
  title="Approve provider's dispute - cancel backjob and resume warranty">
  ‚úÖ Approve Dispute (Side with Provider)
</button>
```

**Improvements:**
- Added emojis for visual clarity
- Clear labels showing who you're siding with
- Tooltips explaining what each action does
- Changed from `space-x-3` to `gap-3` with `flex-wrap` for better responsiveness
